# Tuberculosis DNA extraction directly from sputum

This protocol explains the stepwise process of extracting genomic DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum

## Protocol

* Prepare digestant solution daily by dissolving 250 mg of NALC Reagent per 50 ml of TB Base digestant. Prepare what can be used in 24 hours
* Specimen (sputum) should be collected in a sterile 50 ml screw-cap centrifuge tube.
* Sputum samples should be stored at -20oC when not used immediately
* Transfer 5 ml of sputum specimen into 50 ml aerosol-free, screw-capped centrifuged tube
* Add equal voume of digestant solution to the solution. Avoid touching the lip of the specimen container with reagent bottles. Tighten caps firmly
* Vortex the centrifuge tube until the specimen is liquefied. Check for homogeneity by inverting the tube. An extra pinch of NALC crystals may be added to liquefy excessively mucoid sputa.
* Allow the centrifuge tube sit at room temperature (15 – 30oC) for 15 min. Do not let specimen to sit longer than 20 min
* Fill centrifuge tube within 2cm of the top pf the tube with Phosphate Buffer. Swirl the tube to mix. Avoid touching the lip of the specimen conatiner with the reagent bottles
* Centrifuge at least 15 min at 3600xg
* Wipe the top of the tube with disinfectant
* Under a biosafety cabinet, carefully decant the supernatant into a splash proof container containing a cold sterilant. Wipe the lip of the container with disinfectant. Do not allow the disinfectant to enter the tube
* Repellet the bacteria suspension by centrifugation at 16,000 x g and decant supernatant
* Resuspend pelleted cells in 0.3 ml Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer and transfer into sterile 2 ml screw-cap tubes containing ~250 ul of of 0.1-mm-diameter glass beads
* Heat kill microorganisms at 80oC for 50 minutes and then freeze at -20oC
* After thawing, vortex the tubes for 3 minutes and centrifuge for 5 min at 16,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a clean 2 ml tube for subsequent DNA purification using Dneasy Blood and Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instruction
* Genome copy numbers in the sputum samples were determined using Artus M. tuberculosis RG PCR kit (Qiagen), per manufacturer’s instructions.
